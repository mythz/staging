title: v5.11 Release Notes
slug: v5-11
---

A nice aspect of the flagship features in this release is that they build upon ServiceStack's existing unique 
capabilities to enable even higher value-added features:

 - [Instant Client Apps](#instant-client-apps)
 - [GitHub Action Templates](#github-action-templates)

To capture the unprecedented productivity unlocked by this release we've created a video showing how much
is possible in a few minutes with ServiceStack, starting from just an existing RDBMS: 

<iframe width="896" height="525" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJ7TW-Q_pU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This video walks through creating a new GitHub project with an [empty web project](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Chinook#chinook) from scratch, then:

 - Uses AutoGen to create high-performance AutoQuery & CRUD APIs over the entire Chinook RDBMS
 - Query RDBMS Tables using implicit AutoQuery conventions
 - Convert AutoGen Services into code-first Services
 - Use the synthesized code-base to create a new Artist, Album & Track from a remote typed client
 - Extend AutoQuery Services with typed API Filters
 - Mix in GitHub Actions Template for deploying docker-compose containers to a new Digital Ocean $5/month Droplet
 - Create a GitHub release to automate deployment to our new Droplet
 - Open deployed App in ServiceStack Studio and use its Instant UI to query & create Artists & Albums
 - Open deployed App in Instant Client Apps to craft a C# API from an Auto UI

This guide is [documented every step of the way](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Chinook), follow along 
to unlock these timeless productivity features for yourself!

### Use AutoGen to instantly generate AutoQuery APIs for your RDBMS

We encourage you to try out the magical [AutoGen](/autogen) feature on your own internal RDBMS for the fastest way 
to enter the productive the world of AutoQuery which lets you instantly generate high-performance 
[AutoQuery](/autoquery-rdbms) & [CRUD](/autoquery-crud) APIs around your RDBMS Tables, view them in 
[ServiceStack Studio's](/studio) Auto UI and make use of [Instant Client Apps](#instant-client-apps) to bootstrap 
a new Web, Mobile or Desktop Client App.

### Auto UI in ServiceStack Studio

If you're not familiar with [ServiceStack Studio](/studio) yet we've created a new guided tour highlight video focusing 
on how AutoQuery services can help developers and non-developers alike get Instant UI access their Systems data.

ServiceStack Studio can be used for rapid prototyping or as a generic UI to manage services, data, users, permissions 
and validation. Studio has acquired a number of capabilities & features already that we've tried to highlight in
this feature video:

<iframe width="896" height="525" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kN7371bqUII" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Value of APIs

A primary goal for ServiceStack is to capture your systems functionality in a typed Service contract that yields
the most reusable & evolvable API design. It's why ServiceStack encourages a contract-first,
message-based & coarse-grained typed API Design, which not only benefits the evolution of your Service APIs behind
its most reusable form, but also benefits ServiceStack who's able to maximize the utility of your Services
and make it available in multiple endpoints (e.g. HTTP,MQ,gRPC,SOAP,Service & RPC Gateway), call styles & 
serialization formats, more than any other Services framework.

The other side of the API boundary is the other important area where APIs can add the most value by making it
as simple as possible for API Consumers to call your APIs thereby making your APIs more appealing and creating 
multiplicative value with the time & effort saved by each API consumer.

### Optimal end-to-end development UX

Providing the best end-to-end API development UX is where ServiceStack has excelled for over a decade where
it's still one of the only solutions allowing for an optimal end-to-end API without code-gen, which it enables
for multiple [generic .NET Service Clients](/csharp-client#built-in-clients) in multiple 
[text & binary formats](/csharp-client#httpwebrequest-service-clients) all implementing the same 
substitutable interfaces. This ability is a consequence of design in capturing your entire API boundary into
perfectly symmetrical impl-free Service Contracts where the same DTOs Services implement on the Server are also 
what clients use to invoke APIs.

The benefit afforded from this design extends to each of the popular Web, Mobile & Desktop
[Add ServiceStack Reference](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference) languages ServiceStack
natively supports, as they only need be concerned with generating impl-free, declarative DTO Service Contracts 
in each language. This results in much richer DTOs whose code generation also captures exported interfaces
& declarative route information, API metadata & Validation attributes in languages that support it as well
as exporting more optimal & specific types as it's able to translate types directly from .NET's richer type system 
instead of the more restrictive primitive data types set found in other generic code-gen solutions.

The benefits for only needing to generate DTOs is multifold, there's less boilerplate code to generate, the models
are richer, cleaner and more reusable as POCO data models within client applications. They also can used within
smart generic Service Clients that maintains higher-level functionality beyond a generic HTTP Client with built-in 
support for Authentication, Auto Retries, Auto Batched Requests, Stateful Cookie Sessions, etc. wrapped behind
a consistent and idiomatic generic client interface.

## Instant Client Apps

Building upon our native end-to-end typed solutions, we're excited to announce **Instant Client Apps** to 
provide instant utility and value around your ServiceStack Services where your API consumers can use the 
Auto generated UI to craft API Requests in their preferred programming language:

![](../images/client-apps/client-apps.png)

### Customize Download

A benefit to owning the entire code-generation technology stack is being able to control the complete end-user 
development experience and provide richer more customizable features like choosing to download **all API DTOs**,
only DTOs defined within a [tag group](/api-design#group-services-by-tag) for Systems that group their APIs into 
targeted collections (e.g. `[web]`,`[mobile]`,`[desktop]`) whilst users who are only interested in only calling 1 API 
can download just that **single Request DTO** (inc. all its dependencies) for a much smaller & more tailored download.    

![](../images/client-apps/craft-api.png)

### Download .zip

Instant Client Apps also caters for users that prefer not to install any software who can download a .zip of their
Client App pre-configured with their ProjectName that they can unzip and run in their preferred dev environment
that way.

### Open Instantly in preferred IDE

At its most productive, API Users who've installed our cross-platform utility will be able to instantly open their
crafted API directly in their preferred IDE. The previously time & effort intensive task for users to setup a new 
development environment to be able to explore your API in their preferred language and IDE is now reduced to seconds.

### Mix into an existing code-base

Another popular use-case that's catered for is being able to non-destructively [mix](/mix-tool) the client App 
source files directly into existing code bases, preserving any existing files.

This is also useful for Client Applications that need to start from an existing scaffolded project template like
incorporating their client Dart App into a new Flutter Mobile App as seen in this video:

<iframe width="896" height="525" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTnuMhvUayg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Share Executable API Examples

A nice feature of Instant Client Apps is that each custom API Example compiles down into a single URL which can be 
easily shared, linked to and embedded in Docs & Emails. E.g. You can view the Typed Chinook AutoQuery API Example 
used in the video and docs from the link below:

 - [apps.servicestack.net/#chinook.netcore.io/csharp/AutoQuery/QueryArtists(ArtistIdBetween:[1,100],NameStartsWith:F)](https://apps.servicestack.net/#chinook.netcore.io/csharp/AutoQuery/QueryArtists(ArtistIdBetween:[1,100],NameStartsWith:F))

Which captures the remote ServiceStack **BaseUrl**, the **C#** Language to view the example in, the selected 
**AutoQuery** Tag Group, the **QueryArtists** Request DTO being queried and all its **populated properties**.  

### Embed API Examples to create Interactive API Docs

A richer experience you can offer your API Consumers beyond sharing links to API Examples is being able to 
generate interactive API docs around your APIs. 

To further this goal [apps.servicestack.net](https://apps.servicestack.net) also lets you capture API Examples into
embeddable iframes that you can embed into your API Docs, e.g:

[![](../images/client-apps/instant-apps-example-3.gif)](https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/doc-generation)

For a quick preview of this we've created an API Docs example site around the Covid Vaccines APIs used in
the [Instant Client Apps Flutter Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5crcDfl467Q) above:

##### [servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/](https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/)

 - [QueryData](https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/autoquery)
 - [Get Locations](https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/get-locations)

[![](../images/client-apps/covid-vac-watch-embed-docs-example-1.png)](https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/autoquery)

Here we show an example of skinning the embeddable API Docs inside of our own jQuery UI Tab plugins widget that
is then embedded inside the API docs pages.

Being able to quickly and effortlessly generate beautiful API docs is an area we want to explore more in future.
We don't believe trying to mechanically automate API docs generation is going to result in the best API docs for your 
end users, instead we envisage it should end up being a mix of static documentation around interactive code examples 
where you have full flexibility in how its presented to the end user. But it should be something we can provide
tools to help scaffold a static site around interactive code examples that they'll be able to open with a single 
click directly in their IDE.

### Synthesize API Code Examples

A side-effect of Instant Client Apps being stateless is that they require your API to always be accessible as
it uses its API metadata and Server Generated DTOs in order to generate the Client App Source files. It does maintain
a short cache of both in order to provide a responsive UX, but otherwise your API needs to be live which is 
potentially an undesirable trait for API docs that you want users to still be able to read whilst your API
is down or undergoing maintenance.

However this is easy enough to workaround by synthesizing the dynamic source files and publishing them to an immutable 
gist. To do this you can either download & extract **MyApp.zip** or copy the **MIX INTO DIRECTORY** script to write all 
the files into a new folder which you can then publish to a gist with the `x publish` command:

```
$ x publish -desc "Chinook Query Artists Example"
```

This will create a gist under your GitHub account and print both the link to your GitHub Gist and viewing it
in [gist.cafe](https://gist.cafe):

```
published to: https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/d3a0dfcd0851d928badad66b90affc06

view in: https://gist.cafe/d3a0dfcd0851d928badad66b90affc06
```

Going to [gist.cafe](https://gist.cafe) will let you further customize the embeddable code example and provide
multiple embed options, e.g. you can simply replace the gist id in the `<script/>` tag below:

```html
<script src="https://gist.cafe/embed/d3a0dfcd0851d928badad66b90affc06.js"></script>
```

> To publish gists you'll need to generate a 
[GitHub Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=gist&description=gist.cafe) with **gist** scope 
and add it to your `GITHUB_TOKEN` Environment Variable.

## JWT Refresh Token Cookies

JWT now includes first-class support for Refresh Token Cookies which is implicitly enabled when configuring the 
`JwtAuthProvider` to use Cookies:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(() => new AuthUserSession(),
    new IAuthProvider[] {
        new JwtAuthProvider {
            UseTokenCookie = true,
        },
    }));
```

Which upon authentication will return the Refresh Token in a `ss-reftok` **Secure**, **HttpOnly** Cookie alongside 
the Users stateless Authenticated UserSession in the JWT `ss-tok` Cookie.

The benefit of maintaining smart, generic Service Clients for all [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference)
languages is being able to provide a nicer (i.e. maintenance-free) development experience with all Service Clients
now including built-in support for Refresh Token Cookies where they’ll automatically fetch new JWT Bearer Tokens & 
transparently Auto Retry Requests on 401 Unauthorized responses.

Configuring to use JWT with `UseTokenCookie` transparently switches clients from using Server session-based 
Authentication to stateless JWT Auth Tokens that, without additional effort or machinery, will be able to make
use of Refresh Token Cookies to re-validate & fetch new JWT Bearer Tokens behind the scenes.

Seeing how to make authenticated Typed API Requests in each language is a good illustration of ServiceStack's
consistent familiar development model enabled by the idiomatic generic Service Clients available to each 
supported programming language:

### C#, F# & VB .NET Service Clients

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl);
var authRequest = new Authenticate {
    provider = "credentials",
    UserName = userName,
    Password = password,
};
var authResponse = client.Post(authRequest);

//client.GetTokenCookie();        // JWT Bearer Token
//client.GetRefreshTokenCookie(); // JWT Refresh Token

// When no longer valid, Auto Refreshes JWT Bearer Token using Refresh Token Cookie
var response = client.Post(new SecureRequest { Name = "World" }); 

Inspect.printDump(response); // print API Response into human-readable format (alias: `response.PrintDump()`)
```

### TypeScript & JS Service Client

```ts
let client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl);
let authRequest = new Authenticate({ provider:"credentials", userName, password });
let authResponse = await client.post(authRequest);

// In Browser can't read "HttpOnly" Token Cookies by design, In Node.js can access client.cookies  

// When no longer valid, Auto Refreshes JWT Bearer Token using Refresh Token Cookie
let response = await client.post(SecureRequest({ name: "World" }));

Inspect.printDump(response); // print API Response into human-readable format
```

### Dart Service Clients

```dart
var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl);
var authRequest = Authenticate(provider:"credentials", userName:userName, password:password);
var authResponse = await client.post(authRequest)

//client.getTokenCookie()        // JWT Bearer Token
//client.getRefreshTokenCookie() // JWT Refresh Token

// When no longer valid, Auto Refreshes JWT Bearer Token using Refresh Token Cookie
var response = await client.post(SecureRequest(name:"World"));

Inspect.printDump(response); // print API Response into human-readable format
```

### Java & Kotlin Service Clients

```java
JsonServiceClient client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl);
Authenticate authRequest = new Authenticate()
    .setProvider("credentials")
    .setUserName(userName)
    .setPassword(password));
AuthenticateResponse authResponse = client.post(authRequest);

//client.getTokenCookie();         // JWT Bearer Token
//client.getRefreshTokenCookie();  // JWT Refresh Token

// When no longer valid, Auto Refreshes JWT Bearer Token using Refresh Token Cookie
SecureResponse response = client.post(new SecureRequest().setName("World"));

Inspect.printDump(response); // print API Response into human-readable format
```

### Swift Service Client

```swift
let client = JsonServiceClient(baseUrl: baseUrl);
let authRequest = Authenticate()
authRequest.provider = "credentials"
authRequest.userName = userName
authRequest.password = password
let authResponse = try client.post(authRequest)

//client.getTokenCookie()        // JWT Bearer Token
//client.getRefreshTokenCookie() // JWT Refresh Token

// When no longer valid, Auto Refreshes JWT Bearer Token using Refresh Token Cookie
let request = SecureRequest()
request.name = "World"
let response = try client.post(request)

Inspect.printDump(response) // print API Response into human-readable format
```

### Built-in Inspect Utils

Each client library also includes Inspect utils for being able to quickly dump typed API Responses in 
a human-friendly view for immediate inspection:

```ts
class Inspect {
    // Dump object graphs into a human-readable format
    static dump(obj: any): string;
    static printDump(obj: any): void;

    // Dump tabular results into a human-readable ascii (GitHub Flavored) markdown table
    static dumpTable(rows: any[]): string;
    static printDumpTable(rows: any[]): void;

    // If INSPECT_VARS configured, serializes object for inspection after run, e.g. in https://gist.cafe
    static vars(obj: any): void;
}
```

Example Usage:

```ts
var response = await client.send(request)
Inspect.printDump(response)
```

Or dump a markdown table for quickly visualizing a list of tabular results:

```ts
Inspect.printDumpTable(response.results)
```

## GitHub Action Templates

![](../images/actions/github-actions-header.png)

We've begun to fully embrace GitHub Actions from this release to help quickly setting up CI environments for 
new and existing ServiceStack project templates by automating them into building and running tests on each **commit** 
before publishing, dockerizing & deploying them on each **GitHub Release**. 
The templates leverage [mix](/mix-tool) to work like lego pieces where they can be combined to achieve your 
preferred automation workflow.

To start off with the initial templates are focused on enabling the most cost effective deployment scenarios 
for deploying .NET 5 Apps to a single target host. Here's a list of the initial GitHub Action templates
along with the scenarios they enable:

 - (`build`) Build & Run Tests on each **commit**
 - Deploying to any **Vanilla** Linux Host via **SSH** on each new **GitHub Release**
   - (`release-ghr-vanilla`) Publishing Docker App to [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry)
   - (`release-hub-vanilla`) Publishing Docker App to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
   - (`release-ecr-vanilla`) Publishing Docker App to [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)
 - Deploying to **AWS EC2** Instance via **ECS** on each new **GitHub Release**
   - (`release-ecr-aws`) Publishing Docker App to [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

The `build` template is a generic GitHub Workflow that all project templates can use to build the solution and
run its tests on each commit. They can be combined with the **release** templates using the naming convention of 
`release-{docker_image_repo}-{host_type}` to cater for different workflows with multiple provider options.

E.g. our [Chinook Deployment video guide and docs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Chinook#deploy-to-digital-ocean-droplet-using-github-actions-and-ssh)
enabled its GitHub Actions automated deployments by mixing in `build` and `release-ghr-vanilla` templates:

    $ x mix build release-ghr-vanilla

For maximum utility and simplified automation the Release Workflows follows a pattern for packaging your published 
.NET 5 App into a Docker container, publishing it to your preferred Docker Image Repository before being deployed 
as part of a customizable docker-compose template for maximum flexibility in deploying your App with its 
infrastructure dependencies. 

### .NET 5 Web Projects Templates now includes Dockerfile

In conjunction with the GitHub Action Templates for deployments all .NET 5 Web Project templates include a 
`Dockerfile` which know how to build itself making it generically useful for packaging your App into a 
portable Docker image suitable for deployment to a large number of hosting providers that support various container 
hosting options.

Existing ServiceStack Projects can use `x mix` to download the `Dockerfile` for ServiceStack's 
[Single Page App Project Templates](/templates-single-page-apps) that utilize npm:

    $ x mix docker-dotnet-spa

Other Project Templates utilizing ServiceStack's standard [multi-project physical structure](/physical-project-structure)
can instead download:

    $ x mix docker-dotnet

### Cost Effective Deployment Templates

The initial Action templates are focused on cost effective hosting solutions where multiple .NET 5 Apps across 
multiple GitHub repositories can be conveniently deployed to a single shared server - ideal for hosting multiple small Apps.

To get an idea of the cost effectiveness of deploying and densely packing multiple .NET 5 Apps in a single host
we've converted our new & existing Live Demos and Project Templates to be deployed with these new GitHub workflows:

### 20x Starting Project Templates deployed to Digital Ocean

All [.NET Core Project Templates](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates) Live Demos have been deployed to a
**$10/month** Digital Ocean Droplet:

![](../images/actions/do-droplet.png)

Which is currently running **22** Docker Containers: **20 .NET 5 Apps** + 2x Nginx/Nginx LetsEncrypt Docker Containers
that handles the auto registration, reverse proxying, SSL terminations & load-balanced rotations of Docker Web Apps 
as well as the auto registration & renewals of LetsEncrypt SSL Certificates.

The last 7 days CPU Usage chart shows it comfortably running below 5% CPU Usage and currently using
**1.34G** RAM (69%):

![](../images/actions/do-cpu.png)
![](../images/actions/do-htop.png)

Thanks to predictable pricing of Digital Ocean Droplets we can calculate the cost of hosting each Web App:

<h3 class="text-center text-green-500">$0.50 per .NET 5 Docker App /month</h3>

### 10x .NET Live Demos deployed to AWS ECS

10x of our [.NET 5 Live Demos](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/LiveDemos) has been deployed using `release-ecr-aws`
to a 2x vCPU, 4GB RAM **t3.medium** instance:

![](../images/actions/t3-instance-details.png)

The instance is running a total of **15x** Docker Containers: **10x .NET 5 Apps**, **2x Redis**, 
**2x Nginx** companion containers and **1x** AWS ECS agent which is idling around **1% CPU** and just under 
**50% RAM** usage: 

![](../images/actions/ecs-metrics.png)

This **t3.medium** instance costs **$411** over a 3-Year term, averaging $11.42 /month:

![](../images/actions/t3-medium-pricing-3y.png)

Total hosting costs are more unpredictable on the cloud which incur additional variable costs like bandwidth and
storage but they're currently only a marginal expense on our low traffic Live Demos where total hosting cost is 
just over:

<h3 class="text-center text-green-500">$1.42 per .NET 5 Docker App /month</h3>

## GitHub Action Templates Video Guides

We've created video guides to help walk through the entire process from creating a new project template, 
setting up your deployment server, configuring your App's DNS and deployment configuration and creating a 
new GitHub Release to initiate App deployments.  

### GitHub Container Registry deployed to a Linux server via SSH

The first GitHub Actions Template we'll look at is `release-ghr-vanilla` which uses GitHub's own Container Repository 
([ghcr.io](https://ghcr.io)) to deploy to a standalone "Vanilla" Linux server that can host multiple .NET Apps.

GitHub Actions deploys to this stand alone Linux server via SSH and an `nginx-proxy` container along with a 
LetsEncrypt companion container that takes care of registration & renewal of SSL Certs.

<iframe width="896" height="525" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PvzcnxlBvc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Please also refer to the [documented guide](/do-github-action-mix-deployment) when setting up your own project
deployments for the first time.

There are two other variations on this template for using alternative Docker Image Repositories:

 - `release-hub-vanilla` - Docker Hub Container Repository
 - `release-ecr-vanilla` - AWS Elastic Container Repository

### AWS ECS without an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

If you're invested in AWS platform we've also created a video guide for the `release-ecr-aws` GitHub Actions Template
that uses AWS ECS (EC2 Container Service) to handle deployments to a **single**  EC2 server with Nginx Docker 
Containers handling the reverse proxying and managing the LetsEncrypt SSL Certs. 

This is a cost effective way to get multiple Apps deployed using ECS by avoiding ALB costs for non-scale out solutions
that only need to run on a single instance.

<iframe width="896" height="525" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eh4tvLN8i8g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Please follow the [written tutorial](/mix-github-actions-aws-ecs) for more details on how the templates work 
and setting up the required AWS configuration.

The GitHub Action Template can also serve as a starting point to modify it to support the more traditional 
and robust ECS setup utilizing an ALB to support high availability and horizontal scaling. 

> In future we'll look at creating GitHub Action templates that scale out with cloud vendor offerings

### Postman v2 Collections

An alternative popular UI used to access HTTP APIs is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) which has seen its support
improved thanks to [Michael Rall](https://forums.servicestack.net/u/mrall) who's contributed support for Postman
v2.1 collections.

It's currently being delivered as a source based plugin that can be enabled in all 
[Modular ServiceStack Apps](/modular-startup) with:

    $ x mix postman2

To provide yet another way to access your ServiceStack APIs, e.g: 

![](../images/plugins/postman2.png)

## All Service Client Libraries Upgraded

In addition to the Refresh Token support & built-in Inspect utils all ServiceStack's generic Service Client libraries 
in all languages have received a number of updates to improve their consistency and overall development UX.

### .NET DTO Type Converters

To provide a consistent dev UX around .NET Interop all client libraries include consistently named utility methods 
to convert to/from a language's native Types and .NET DTO Types which can be used outside of Service Clients, e.g.
in a platforms general purpose HTTP Clients:

#### Swift 

[ServiceStack.Swift](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Swift) top-level utility functions:

- `func fromDateTime(_ jsonDate:String) -> Date?` - From .NET DateTime (WCF JSON or ISO Date) to Swift Date
- `func toDateTime(_ dateTime:Date) -> String` - From Swift Date to .NET DateTime (WCF JSON Date)
- `func fromTimeSpan(timeSpan:String) -> TimeInterval?` - From .NET TimeSpan (XSD Duration) to Swift TimeInterval
- `func toTimeSpan(timeInterval:TimeInterval) -> String` - From Swift TimeInterval to .NET TimeSpan (XSD Duration)
- `func fromByteArray(_ base64String:String) -> [UInt8]` - From .NET byte[] (Base64 String) to Swift [UInt8]
- `func toByteArray(_ bytes:[UInt8]) -> String` - From Swift [UInt8] to .NET byte[] (Base64 String)
- `func fromGuid(_ guid:String) -> String` - From .NET Guid to Guid string
- `func fromByteArray(_ base64String:String) -> [UInt8]` - From Guid string to .NET Guid

#### Dart (VM / Flutter & Web)

[servicestack](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-dart) Dart library top-level utility functions:

- `DateTime fromDateTime(String jsonDate)` - From .NET DateTime (WCF JSON or ISO Date) to Dart DateTime
- `String toDateTime(DateTime dateTime)` - From Dart DateTime to .NET DateTime (WCF JSON Date)
- `Duration fromTimeSpan(String str)` - From .NET TimeSpan (XSD Duration) to Dart Duration
- `String toTimeSpan(Duration duration)` - From Dart Duration to .NET TimeSpan (XSD Duration)
- `Uint8List fromByteArray(String base64String)` - From .NET byte[] (Base64 String) to Dart Uint8List
- `String toByteArray(Uint8List bytes)` - From Dart Uint8List to .NET byte[] (Base64 String)
- `String fromGuid(String guid)` - From .NET Guid to Guid string
- `String toGuid(String guid)` - From Guid string to .NET Guid

#### Java / Kotlin (JVM & Android)

[ServiceStack.Java](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Java) defines their DTO conversion functions
as static helpers on `Utils.*` class:

- `Date fromDateTime(String jsonDate)` - From .NET DateTime (WCF JSON or ISO Date) to JVM Date
- `String toDateTime(Date date)` - From JVM Date to .NET DateTime (WCF JSON Date)
- `TimeSpan fromTimeSpan(String xsdDuration)` - From .NET TimeSpan (XSD Duration) to Java TimeSpan
- `String toTimeSpan(TimeSpan timeSpan)` - From Java TimeSpan to .NET TimeSpan (XSD Duration)
- `UUID fromGuid(String guid)` - From .NET Guid to JVM UUID
- `String toGuid(UUID uuid)` - From JVM UUID to .NET Guid
- `byte[] fromByteArray(String base64)` - From .NET byte[] (Base64 String) to JVM signed byte[]
- `String toByteArray(byte[] bytes)` - From JVM signed byte[] to .NET byte[] (Base64 String)

#### TypeScript (Web & Node.js)

[@servicestack/client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-client) libraries top-level DTO Type conversion functions:

```ts
function fromDateTime(dateTime: string): Date;
function toDateTime(date: Date): string;
function fromTimeSpan(xsdDuration: string): string;
function toTimeSpan(xsdDuration: string): string;
function fromGuid(xsdDuration: string): string;
function toGuid(xsdDuration: string): string;
function fromByteArray(base64: string): Uint8Array;
function toByteArray(bytes: Uint8Array): string;
function toBase64String(source: string): string;
```

### Swift library rewritten to use Codable Types

The [ServiceStack.Swift](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Swift) client library has been rewritten to 
conform to Apple's standardized 
[Swift's Codable Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types)
whose built-in compiler support results in much cleaner and more reusable DTOs that can be reused as data models
throughout your App, saved and loaded with Swift's built-in Serializers and interoperate with other 3rd party libraries 
that also support Codable models.

### Codable DTOs

By default ServiceStack now generates clean "implementation-free" Codable DTOs for all general Types supported by 
Swift's compiler, e.g:

```swift
// @Route("/posts/{Id}", "GET")
public class GetPost : IReturn, IGet, Codable
{
    public typealias Return = GetPostResponse

    public var id:Int?
    public var include:String?

    required public init(){}
}
```

It also supports auto generating Codable implementations for Types that Swift's compiler doesn't support default
Codable implementations, namely inherited Types & types with self references. 
This limitation includes all AutoQuery DTOs since they inherit from `QueryDb<T>`, where they'll have their Codable 
implementation generated with their DTO, e.g:

```swift
// @Route("/customers", "GET")
// @Route("/customers/{CustomerId}", "GET")
public class QueryCustomers : QueryDb<Customers>, IReturn, IGet
{
    public typealias Return = QueryResponse<Customers>

    public var customerId:Int?

    required public init(){ super.init() }

    private enum CodingKeys : String, CodingKey {
        case customerId
    }

    required public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        try super.init(from: decoder)
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        customerId = try container.decodeIfPresent(Int.self, forKey: .customerId)
    }

    public override func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        try super.encode(to: encoder)
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        if customerId != nil { try container.encode(customerId, forKey: .customerId) }
    }
}
```

Should you want to, you can force Types to generate their explicit Codable implementation with the new 
`[Synthesize]` attribute:

```csharp
[Synthesize]
public class MyRequest { ... }
```

### Swift Value Type Converters

This release also includes support for custom Type serialization when you want to serialize a custom .NET Type directly
into a native Swift Type. These extensible APIs are used for converting a .NET `TimeSpan` into a Swift `TimeInterval`.

#### .NET TimeSpan to Swift TimeInterval Example

Firstly a Type Alias should be registered with Swift code-gen API to specify which Swift Type a .NET Type should be 
generated as in the Swift DTOs, e.g:

```csharp
SwiftGenerator.TypeAliases["TimeSpan"] = "TimeInterval";
```

Swift client Apps would then need to register a Converter that implements `StringConvertible` specifying which Type
it's converting as well as its convertible implementation, e.g.

```swift
Converters.register(TimeIntervalConverter())
```

ServiceStack.Swift's built-in `TimeIntervalConverter` uses the TimeSpan DTO Type Converters above to do this:

```swift
public class TimeIntervalConverter : StringConvertible {
    public var forType = Reflect<TimeInterval>.typeName

    public func fromString<T>(_ type: T.Type, _ string: String) -> T? {
        return fromTimeSpan(string) as? T
    }
    public func toString<T>(instance: T) -> String? {
        return toTimeSpan(instance as! TimeInterval)
    }
}
```

An alternative solution is to have the Swift Type implement the [LosslessStringConvertible](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/losslessstringconvertible) 
protocol in which case you can then just register the Type itself, e.g:

```swift
Converters.register(TimeInterval.self)
```

### Upgrade to ServiceStack.Swift v5

To use the new Codable support your Apps will need to upgrade to use the latest **v5.x** ServiceStack.Swift package:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(name: "ServiceStack", 
        url: "https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Swift.git", 
        Version(5,0,0)..<Version(6,0,0)),
],
```

### Reverting to legacy Swift DTOs

If you're not ready to upgrade to use the latest Swift 5 and Codable DTOs support you can revert to use previous 
in-house JSON Swift DTO implementation by using `swift4` when downloading and updating your Server DTOs:

    $ x swift4 https://techstacks.io

You'll also need to use **v1.x** of the **ServiceStack.Swift** library:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(name: "ServiceStack", url: "https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Swift.git", 
        Version(1,0,0)..<Version(2,0,0)),
],
```

We'll be maintaining the old Swift version until the next major ServiceStack release to enable staged migrations 
to the new Swift Client Library and Codable DTOs.

### Dart Add ServiceStack Reference

The [servicestack Dart library](https://pub.dev/packages/servicestack) and generated Dart DTOs received a lot of focus 
to improve support for minified production Flutter Web builds now that [Flutter support Web Apps](https://flutter.dev/web) 
by default whose minified obfuscated Types meant we had to workaround relying on Type Info at runtime which instead 
required each DTO to embed its non minified Type name.

#### Common Shared Base Classes Included

The client library now also includes AutoQuery & Auto CRUD base classes and interfaces which reduces the amount of 
generated code each API endpoint needs to generate whilst enabling code sharing & reuse when importing multiple 
ServiceStack references from different remote endpoints as they now share the same library base classes and interfaces.

#### Dart Debug Logging

To help with diagnosing production runtime issues, logging has been added throughout the library.
A `ConsoleLogger` with **Warn** and **Error** log levels is enabled by default, whilst debug logging can be enabled with:

 ```dart
void main() {
  Log.levels.add(LogLevel.Debug);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Logging can be disabled by clearing the log levels or replacing the Logger implementation to a NOOP logger:

 ```dart
Log.levels.clear(); //or
Log.logger = new NullLogger();
```

### Non Nullable Reference Types annotated as Required

If you've enabled [C# 8's nullable reference types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/try-out-nullable-reference-types/) 
in your code-base ServiceStack will report it as a **Required** property in its metadata pages, however they should be 
used in conjunction with a Validation rule to assert that API Requests match the state of your code-base, using either 
a `.NotNull()` Fluent Validation rule or `[ValidateNotNull]` declarative validation attribute, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyRequest
{
    [ValidateNotNull]
    public string A { get; set; }
    public string? B { get; set; }
}
```

### TypeScript Add ServiceStack Reference

Code bases with [strictNullChecks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) enabled may prefer
to generate explicit nullable properties instead of the default optional properties with: 

```csharp
TypeScriptGenerator.UseNullableProperties = true;
```

Where DTOs with a mix of Required and Optional Properties:

```csharp
public class Company
{
   [AutoId,PrimaryKey] 
   public Guid Id { get; set; } = Guid.Empty;
   [Required]
   public int Ranking { get; set; } = 0;
   [Required] 
   public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
   public string? Subname { get; set; } = null;
   [Required] 
   public Guid CountryId { get; set; } = Guid.Empty;
   [Required] 
   public DateTime StatusDate { get; set; } = DateTime.UtcNow;
   public Guid? TurnoverCurrencyId { get; set; } = null;
   public decimal? TurnoverAmount { get; set; } = null;
   public int? EmployeeCount { get; set; } = null;
}
```

Will emit nullable property type annotations for optional properties and non-nullable annotations for required properties, e.g:

```ts
export class Company
{
    public id: string|null;
    // @Required()
    public ranking: number;
    // @Required()
    public name: string;
    public subname: string|null;
    // @Required()
    public countryId: string;
    // @Required()
    public statusDate: string;
    public turnoverCurrencyId: string|null;
    public turnoverAmount: number|null;
    public employeeCount: number|null;
    public constructor(init?: Partial<Company>) { (Object as any).assign(this, init); }
}
```

### Insert @ts-nocheck

Users with strict type checking enabled in the TypeScript code-bases can elect to ignore enforcing their App's
conventions on the generated TypeScript DTOs by configuring 
[@ts-nocheck](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-7-beta/#ts-nocheck-in-typescript-files):

```csharp
TypeScriptGenerator.InsertTsNoCheck = true;
```

Which will add `// @ts-nocheck` to the start of the generated TypeScript DTOs.

### TypeScript Client Library

#### `fetch-everywhere` replaced with `cross-fetch`

To soft reference to the latest version of `node-fetch` without vulnerability warnings, `@servicestack/client`
replaced its internal reference of the abandoned `fetch-everywhere` with [cross-fetch](https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch). 
Only used in non browser environments, inside a browser `@servicestack/client` is a stand-alone library with no dependencies.

#### JSV Serializer now included

ServiceStack supports [sending nested complex-type properties](/serialization-deserialization#passing-complex-objects-in-the-query-string) 
in QueryString and FormData fields using the [/jsv-format](JSV Format) which is now included. Whilst you'd typically 
only need to use `JSV.stringify(obj)` for serializing any JS Object, the `JSV` API includes finer-grained APIs:

```ts
class JSV {
    static ESCAPE_CHARS: string[];
    static encodeString(str: string): string;
    static encodeArray(array: any[]): string;
    static encodeObject(obj: any): string;
    static stringify(obj: any): any;
}
```

#### Google Closure StringBuffer

A TypeScript port of Google Clojure's `StringBuffer` API was included for optimal string concatenation in JS VMs:

```ts
class StringBuffer {
    buffer_: string;
    constructor(opt_a1?: any, ...var_args: any[]);
    set(s: string): void;
    append(a1: any, opt_a2?: any, ...var_args: any[]): this;
    clear(): void;
    getLength(): number;
    toString(): string;
}
```

#### Support for defer includes

Removed all global constants so UMD `/js/servicestack-client.js` works when included as a defer script

#### New JS Utils

A number of useful JS & String manipulation APIs were also added:

```ts
// ES2017 flatMap polyfill 
function flatMap(f: Function, xs: any[]): any;
// return distinct string collection
function uniq(xs: string[]): string[];
// encode HTML
function enc(o: any): string;
// convert JS object into HTML attributes string
function htmlAttrs(o: any): string;
// return index of first needle found
function indexOfAny(str: string, needles: string[]): number;
// return left part of needle
function leftPart(strVal: string, needle: string): string;
// return right part of needle
function rightPart(strVal: string, needle: string): string;
// return last left part of needle
function lastLeftPart(strVal: string, needle: string): string;
// return last right part of needle
function lastRightPart(strVal: string, needle: string): string;
// return new object containing only specified keys
function onlyProps(obj: any, keys: string[]): any;
// return unique keys in object array
function uniqueKeys(rows: any[]): string[];

// Text Alignment Functions used in Inspect Utils
function alignLeft(str: string, len: number, pad?: string): string;
function alignCenter(str: string, len: number, pad?: string): string;
function alignRight(str: string, len: number, pad?: string): string;
function alignAuto(obj: any, len: number, pad?: string): string;
```

#### bindHandlers

The behavior of [bindHandlers()](/servicestack-client-umd#bindhandlers) was changed to invoke the callback bound with 
the target element containing the declarative event handler, so when a declarative event is fired, e.g:

```html
<div data-click="handleClick"><label>Text</label></div>
```

The callback is invoked with the function bound to the element containing the declarative event (`data-click`), e.g:

```js
bindHandlers({
   handleClick: function (evt) {
       let $div = this;
   }
})
```

### Declarative Nested Validators

[Declarative validation](https://docs.servicestack.net/declarative-validation) is our preferred way to declare 
DTO validation rules since they're a natural extension for defining additional validation rules on Typed DTOs which 
provide more detailed information about your Service Contracts which can't be expressed by a programming languages 
Type System.

The new support for nested child validators works intuitively and effortlessly where any Request DTOs with nested 
Type or Collection Child Validators are automatically registered. This removes another use-case previously requiring 
manual configuration using Fluent Validation APIs, now any child validators on nested types or nested collection 
types will be automatically registered, e.g:

```csharp
public class CreateSite : ICreateDb<Site>, IReturn<CreateSiteResponse>
{
    [ValidateMaximumLength(20)]
    public string Site { get; set; }
    public List<SiteProperty> Properties { get; set; }
    public SiteContact Contact { get; set; }
}

public class SiteProperty
{
    [ValidateMaximumLength(20)]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string Value { get; set; }
}

public class SiteContact
{
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    [ValidateEmail]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

When a child collection validator fails its item index and nested property name is included in the validation error 
field name:

```js
{
    ErrorCode: "MaximumLength",
    Message: "The length of 'Name' must be 20 characters or fewer. You entered 32 characters.",
    Errors: [{
        FieldName: "Properties[0].Name"
        ErrorCode: "MaximumLength",
        Message: "The length of 'Name' must be 20 characters or fewer. You entered 32 characters.",
    }]
}
```

Please note the behavior when mixing with existing custom Fluent Validators:

- It will also auto register custom child validators defined using **FluentValidation** APIs
- It wont register child validators for containing Type custom validators defined using FluentValidation APIs

This is to avoid duplicate registration of validators, so when defining a custom validator for a containing Type (e.g. Request DTO)
it will take over fluent validation registration for that type and you would need to manually register its child validators in its custom implementation.

## AutoQuery

### AutoPopulate and AutoMap attributes for QueryDb APIs

The `[AutoPopulate]` and `[AutoMap]` attributes can now be applied to AutoQuery `QueryDb*` DTOs.

[AutoPopulate](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-crud#autopopulate) lets you pre-populate a Request DTO Property with a constant value,
a static expression or a #Script Expression, in this case populates it with the `userAuthName` Script method which returns the Authenticated
User Name, which in this case populates the `CreatedBy` exact match filter to return all Bookings created by the Authenticated User:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(CreatedBy), Eval = "userAuthName")]
[AutoApply(Behavior.AuditQuery)]
public class QueryUserBookings : QueryDb<Booking>
{
    public string CreatedBy { get; set; }
}
```

Whilst [AutoMap](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-crud#automap-and-autodefault-attributes) lets you map the value of a Request DTO
to a DataModel property with a different name which has the same behavior as above to populate the `CreatedBy` exact match filter:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(UserName), Eval = "userAuthName")]
[AutoApply(Behavior.AuditQuery)]
public class QueryUserBookings : QueryDb<Booking>
{
    [AutoMap(nameof(AuditBase.CreatedBy))]
    public string UserName { get; set; }
}
```

### AutoGen

[AutoGen](/autogen) received improvements for generating cleaner POCO models for App's that don't need DataContract 
attributes, e.g. gRPC, protobuf serialization or SOAP:

 - `AddDataContractAttributes` to include `[DataContract]` and `[DataMember]` attributes required by gRPC
 - `AddIndexesToDataMembers`  to include `Order` DataMember property required by gRPC
 - Handle matching RDBMS tables using **snake_case** 

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    MaxLimit = 1000,
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {
        AutoRegister = true,
        AddDataContractAttributes = false, // Don't generate [DataContract] attributes
    }
});
```

## ServiceStack Auth

### JWT Auth Provider

The JWT Auth Provider now includes unique JWT ids (`jti` ) embedded in its issued JWTs which by default uses 
an auto incrementing id but can be customized by implementing the JWT Id Generation delegates:

 - `ResolveJwtId` resolve next unique `jti` JWT ID to embed in JWT Bearer Tokens 
 - `ResolveRefreshJwtId` resolve next unique `jti` JWT ID to embed in JWT Refresh Tokens

These identifiers can be used to uniquely reference issued JWTs, e.g. to prevent replay attacks or 

  - Use `InvalidateJwtIds` to invalidate specific JWT by Id

#### JWT Features

- `RequiresAudience` - Tokens must contain aud which is validated
- `ResolveUnixTime` - Override resolving Unix Timestamps embedded in JWT Tokens
- `PreValidateJwtPayloadFilter` - Inspect JWT Payload prior to validation, return error message if invalid

The JWT Validation functions have been split into different virtual methods to allow Custom JWT Auth Provider 
implementations to override any of the JWT Validation predicates below to change its default behavior:

- `HasExpired()`
- `HasBeenInvalidated()`
- `HasInvalidAudience()`
- `HasInvalidNotBefore()`

#### Inspecting JWT Tokens

The new `JwtAuthProvider.Dump(jwt)` and `JwtAuthProvider.PrintDump(jwt)` APIs can be used to quickly 
dump a human-friendly view of the contents of a JWT Token.

### Microsoft Graph Auth Provider

The `MicrosoftGraphAuthProvider` has been updated by [@DeonHeyns](https://github.com/DeonHeyns) from the ServiceStack 
Community to now populate Application roles that have been 
[assigned via Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps#assign-users-and-groups-to-roles)

### New Auth APIs

- `LoadUserAuthInfoFilterAsync()` is available in all `AuthProvider` to provide an async alternative to loading user auth info
- `GetAuthorization()`, `GetBearerToken()` and `GetJwtToken()` can be overridden in your `AppHost` to customize how each are populated from HTTP Request

### Async RavenDB Auth Repository

The `RavenDbUserAuthRepository` has been rewritten by [Zvjezdan Tomicevic](https://github.com/zeko77) from the 
ServiceStack Community to only use async APIs and upgraded to use the latest **RavenDB.Client** NuGet package.

## ServiceStack Framework

### Async Service Filters

The new `IServiceBeforeFilterAsync` and `IServiceAfterFilterAsync` interfaces can be used to execute custom async 
logic before and after each API in your Service or base class, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyServices : Service, IServiceBeforeFilterAsync, IServiceAfterFilterAsync
{
    public Task OnBeforeExecuteAsync(object requestDto) => ...;

    public Task<object> OnAfterExecuteAsync(object response) => ...;
}
```

### Async Typed Global Filters

There's now equivalent async APIs for each [Typed Request Filter APIs](/request-and-response-filters#typed-request-filters): 

```csharp
public interface IAppHost
{
    // Add an Async Request Filter for a specific Request DTO Type
    void RegisterTypedRequestFilterAsync<T>(Func<IRequest, IResponse, T, Task> filterFn);    

    // Add ITypedFilterAsync as an Async Typed Request Filter for a specific Request DTO Type
    void RegisterTypedRequestFilterAsync<T>(Func<Container, ITypedFilterAsync<T>> filter);

    // Add an Async Request Filter for a specific Response DTO Type
    void RegisterTypedResponseFilterAsync<T>(Func<IRequest, IResponse, T, Task> filterFn);

    // Add ITypedFilterAsync as an Async Typed Request Filter for a specific Request DTO Type
    void RegisterTypedResponseFilterAsync<T>(Func<Container, ITypedFilterAsync<T>> filter);        
}
```

Typed Request Filters let your filters reference typed Request DTOs: 

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    RegisterTypedRequestFilter<Resource>(async (req, res, dto) => {
        dto.ResourceName = await GetResourceNameAsync(dto.TenantName);
    });
}
```

- Can override `ResolveLocalizedStringFormat` in AppHost to localize all built-in end-user visible Error Messages.
- Added `IsDevelopmentEnvironment()`, `IsStagingEnvironment()` and `IsProductionEnvironment()` AppHost convenience ext methods


### Fluent Validation

 - FluentValidation upgraded to v9.5.1

### Server Sent Events

 - Add `StopAsync()` API
 - `Stop()` and `StopAsync()` APIs explicitly disposes all active subscriptions which is called when AppHost disposes
 
### Integration Testing Targeted Services

The `AppSelfHostBase` base class commonly used for multi-platform .NET Core / .NET Framework integration tests 
now allows specifying individual Service classes to allow for more focused tests:

 ```csharp
class AppHost : AppSelfHostBase
{
    public AppHost()
        : base(nameof(MyTests), typeof(TestServices1), typeof(TestServices2)) {}

    public override void Configure(Container container)
    {
        //...
    }
}
```

### Metadata Page Tag Groups

[Tag Group](/api-design#group-services-by-tag) filters now supports back/forward page navigation can be deep linked, 
Tag names are sorted alphabetically:

![](../images/plugins/metadata-tags.png)

### ServiceStack.Desktop

The [heroicons.dev](https://heroicons.dev) SVG solid and outline Icon set has been added to **ServiceStack.Desktop**
so they can now be referenced in Windows [vuedesktop.com](https://www.vuedesktop.com) Templates 

```html
<img src="/lib/svg/heroicons/solid/academic-cap.svg">
<img src="/lib/svg/heroicons/outline/academic-cap.svg">
